# Artificial-Intelligence-Project1

The aim of the project is the creation of a Movie Recommendation System. First af all, we process data given in the file movies_metadata.csv which provides as features of the films given. We put features in lists called literals with which we will categorize the films.Afterwards, we create a world in Prolog wich will enable us to write our predicates. The file containing the predicates is uploaded with the name "predicates" and we use this to query the categories of the films we want. For example "Give me all the films with 3 common genres with the Film Terminator". The queries have been written as well. In addition, some of the predicates have to do with recommendations which are based on the similarity of the films. We created 5 levels of similarity. For example, films with same director have level 1 similarity, films with 3 commons genres and same production company have level 2 similarity and so on. (You can see more details in the file "predicates"). Lastly, the system is upgrated to not just recommending similar movies but movies that matches user's preferations as the user rates films (1 to 5 rate). Finally, we evaluate the system with some given metrics. We highlight that the part of evaluation and the upgrate of the system is based on given code. 

The project created as part of the course "Artificial Intelligence" at School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, NTUA and the aim of this work is NOT to present it as my own research but as my approach to the problems given. Read the project's prompt in the uploaded file for more details about the 3 tasks (It is given in Greek). We highlight that the project was implemented in Google Colab so parts of the code like the file management was done through this environment. Moreover, a  part of the code was given in the prompt.
